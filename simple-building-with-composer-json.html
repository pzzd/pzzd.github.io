	</header>

	<main>

	<p>In Custom PHP Land, it can be complicated to load all server-side and client-side dependencies, libraries, and assets for a web application. However, all dependencies can be declared in a single composer.json in the vhost root.</p>

	<h2>An Example</h2>
<pre class='code'>
{
 "name": "my-org/my-lovely-web-app",
 "description": "My Lovely Web App",
 "license": "proprietary",
 "repositories": [
  {
   "type": "composer",
   "url": "https://my.org.edu/packages/"
  },	
  {
   "type": "git",
   "url": "https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git"
  },
  {
   "type": "git",
   "url": "https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome.git"
  },
  {
   "type": "package",
    "package": {
    "name" : "jquery/jquery",
    "version": "3.4.1",
    "dist": {
     "url": "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js",
     "type": "file"
    }
   }
  },
 ],
 "require": {
  "twig/twig": "3.*",
  "my-org/custom-package": "1.*",
  "fortawesome/font-awesome": "5.15.1",
  "jquery/jquery": "3.4.1",
  "twbs/bootstrap": "v4.4.1"
 },
 "scripts": {
  "post-autoload-dump": [
  "rm -rf app/vendor",
  "mkdir app/vendor",
  "mv vendor/fortawesome app/vendor/fortawesome",
  "mv vendor/jquery app/vendor/jquery",
  "mv vendor/twbs app/vendor/twbs",
  "rm -rf app/vendor/twbs/bootstrap/build app/vendor/twbs/bootstrap/js app/vendor/twbs/bootstrap/nuget app/vendor/twbs/bootstrap/scss app/vendor/twbs/bootstrap/site app/vendor/twbs/bootstrap/*.*"
 ]
 }
}
</pre>

<p>This example assumes the web application has a vhost root (/) and a web root (/app). Server-side dependencies will be saved to /vendor by default.</p>

<p>Client-side dependencies need to be moved to the web root. This can be done by using Composer scripts. The above example saves all dependencies to /vendor; makes a new app/vendor directory; moves the javascript and css libraries to app/vendor; and removes some build files and other junk from one library. The resulting directory structure looks like this:</p>
		
<pre class='code'>
- composer.json
- composer.lock
- vendor
  - my-org
  - twig
- app
  - fortawesome
  - jquery
  - twbs
</pre>

		
<h2>Why use server-side composer.json to declare all dependencies?</h2>

<ul>
	<li>All the dependencies for an app can be found in one single manifest file. It's like a table of contents of all the libraries your app needs.</li>
	<li>All dependencies can be fetched in a single build, instead of one build for PHP dependencies and one buld for JS dependencies.</li>
	<li>GitHub dependency graph and Dependabot alerts refers to composer.json for dependency review and security vulnerabilities.</li>
	<li>You don't have to rely on a CDN for availability and security. If the CDN assets are not available and ‘composer update’ fails, your dependencies don’t disappear.</li>
	<li>You don't have to allow any external domains in Content-Security-Policy headers, because all external resources are now local.
</ul>
