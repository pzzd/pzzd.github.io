My team is about to complete the upgrade of 50+ web apps and a handful of custom packages to PHP 8. This has been a year-long process that provided a lot of lessons! Now is a good opportunity to document what I would recommend for the next big migration, followed by more details about what worked and what did not work.

Background


The only thing in common across all our apps is PHP! Our apps are of different vintages. There is a varying degree of standardization in coding practices and code packages across these apps. The run on different environments, on-prem and off prep, and some are command-line apps. 

We leverage stable PHP packages where possible, but we do have some home-made Composer packages that address the unique needs of our organization.

Our team members, past and present, have spent years getting all our apps and our environments in a state so that each migration is more painless than the previous one. To wit:

Critical behaviors are programmed as testable units (e.g., classes).
We have up-to-date unit tests (e.g., Behat).
Dependencies are explicitly declared in our applications, and we can update them easily (e.g., Composer).
We have some tools at our disposal (e.g., security scanning).
We have some time to standardize our apps to some degree.


Recommended for the next big migration

1. Make a 'PHP Compatibility' Composer package so that inspections can be added easily to a PHP app. This package should include PHPStan two inspection templates: one for the original PHP version and one for the target version. Each web app requires this package in its composer.json. Now you can run inspections, checking for deprecations and important differences. 

2. Write unit tests for custom code packages and critical chunks of code in each web app. Get the tests to a passing state on the current PHP environment to establish the baseline behavior. In the new environment, run the tests and refactor to pass the unit tests.

3. Record automation testing scripts for critical web apps in the original environment to establish baseline behavior. Then run them in the new environment, refactoring to pass the automation tests.

4. Use a security scanning tool to check for indications of PHP errors in the new environment, particularly information leakage.


What worked and what didn't

I can boil it down to this list of recommendations after trying several different strategies to predict where are our apps might run into problems in PHP 8. Here is a review of those strategies.




Search for changelog issues using an artisanal bash script

It took a long time to write simple greps looking for potential issues based on the changelog. The results were not impressive, and so I would not go through this effort again. Better off sticking with open-source code inspections that thousands of other programmers are using and contributing to.


Compare PHP Storm inspections for PHP 7.4 and 8.1

I created a custom inspection configuration for PHP Storm, enabling only the minimum inspection tools for PHP. In PHP Storm, you can set the language version in the editor. So by using a custom inspection template, and comparing code inspections between PHP 7.4 and 8.1, you can see what PHP Storm thinks of your 7.4 code running on 8.1. This turned up a lot of potential issues (e.g., undefined constants, warnings about the @ operator not silencing fatal errors), most of which turned out to be non-issues. The most reliable findings were deprecated functions like money_format and the magic_quotes functions and predefined variables like $php_errormsg.

But there is an easier way to get at deprecations. PHP Storm uses the PHPStan open source library for many of its inspections. Because I don't typically use PHP Storm, because it requires a license, and because you have to open the desktop editor to run an inspection, I would not use it again. There is just too much manual work for the amount of code we needed to migrate, and PHPStan was just as effective...

Compare PHPStan inspections for PHP 7.4 and 8.0

I created PHPStan inspection templates for PHP 7.4 and 8.0 in order to compare inspections from a command line. Then running and comparing the inspections was very easy, using the `diff` command. Like PHP Storm, there was a lot of noise. Again, the most useful results were deprecations. Since PHPStan was so easy to set up, use, and potentially automate, I would use it again for the next big migration. 

Since PHPStan was wholly command line, this turned out to be an easy option to quickly check for deprecations:

```
cd my-web-app

vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit 1G -c vendor/ws/php-compatibility/phpstan/php7-4.neon > ~/Downloads/phpstan-php7-4.txt

vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit 1G -c vendor/ws/php-compatibility/phpstan/php8-0.neon > ~/Downloads/phpstan-php8-0.txt

diff ~/Downloads/phpstan-php7-4.txt ~/Downloads/phpstan-php8-0.txt
```

It was good to have the flexibility to run inspections from the web server because some apps use components  that would be very difficult to deploy on a laptop (e.g., caching).



Put inspections in a Composer package

I bundled the PHP Storm inspection template, the PHPStan inspection configs, and my artisanal bash script into a Composer package. This made it very easy to add inspection configs into a an app by requiring the package with Composer. In the future, I would only include PHPStan other open-source library that worked as easily and as well. 

For future PHP updates, it could potentially be very easy to update the compatibility package. I would also like to explore automating a check against PHPStan or our custom compatibility package with GitHub.


Unit test comparison

Even though a lot of the prep work for inspecting code didn't turn out to be useful, it did give us a heads-up that we were going to have to efficiently test a lot of code in order to migrate so many web apps! For critical custom packages that most of our apps use, I wrote Behat unit tests that pass in PHP 7.4 in order to run them in 8.1 and fix the issues that arose. This was a ton of work, but turned out to be an excellent use of time and effort.


Testing by hand

Testing as a human user of a web app is the most time-intensive and faulty because it's very difficult to guarantee good code coverage. But it was probably necessary to make sure a web app works minimally. I would love to try out an automated user testing tool next time around!


Security scans

We also leaned on our security scanning tool to identify "information leakage" vulnerabilities; that is, any PHP errors resulting from old code running on a new environment plus any bugs introduced in refactoring. This is an off-label use for a DAST, but our team can't compete with the shear number of requests and coverage. If you are suppressing errors, analyze error logs during the period of the security scan.
