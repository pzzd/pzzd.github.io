My team is about to complete a project to migrate 50+ web apps to PHP 8. To reduce the mystery, I tried several different strategies to predict where are our apps might run into problems in an upgraded environment. Here is a review of those strategies.

Compare PHP Storm inspections for PHP 7.4 and 8.1

I created a custom inspection configuration for PHP Storm, enabling on the minimum inspection tools for PHP. In PHP Storm, you can set the language version in the editor. So by using a custom inspection template, and comparing code inspections between PHP 7.4 and 8.1, you can see what PHP Storm thinks of your 7.4 code running on 8.1. This turned up a lot of potential issues, especially undefined constants, a warning about the @ operator not silencing fatal errors, most of which turned ut to be non-issues. The most reliable findings were deprecated functions like money_format and the magic_quotes functions and predefined variables like $php_errormsg.

Compare PHPStan inspections for PHP 7.4 and 8.0

I was curious if we could compare the same inspections from a command line, too, and so I created inspection templates for PHP 7.4 and 8.0 (8.1 was not supported at the time). Then running the inspections was very easy, using the `diff` command. Like PHP Storm, which happens to use PHP Stan, there was a lot of noise. Again, the most useful results were deprecations.

Search for changelog issues using a home-made bash script

It took a long time to write simple greps looking for potential issues based on the changelog. The results were not impressive, and so I would not go through this effort again.

Put inspections in a Composer package

I bundled the PHP Storm inspection template, the PHPStan inspection configs, and my home-made bash script into a Composer package. This made it very easy to add inspection configs into a web app deployed on the web server of cloned to a laptop by requiring the package with Composer. Since PHPStan was wholly command line, this turned out to be an easy option to quickly check for deprecations:

```
cd my-web-app

vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit 1G -c vendor/ws/php-compatibility/phpstan/php7-4.neon > ~/Downloads/phpstan-php7-4.txt

vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit 1G -c vendor/ws/php-compatibility/phpstan/php8-0.neon > ~/Downloads/phpstan-php8-0.txt

diff ~/Downloads/phpstan-php7-4.txt ~/Downloads/phpstan-php8-0.txt
```

It was good to have the flexibility to run inspections from the web server because some web apps use components (e.g., caching) that would be very difficult to deploy on a laptop.


Unit test comparison

Even though a lot of the prep work for inspecting code didn't turn out to be useful, it did give us a heads-up that we were going to have to efficiently test a lot of code in order to migrate so many web apps! For critical custom packages that most of our apps use, I wrote Behat unit tests that pass in PHP 7.4 in order to run them in 8.1 and fix the issues that arose. This was a ton of work, but turned out to be an excellent use of time and effort because the test results make it easy to identify and fix issues.


Testing by hand

Testing as a user of a web app is the most time-intensive and faulty because it's very difficult to guarantee good code coverage. But it was probably the most useful to make sure a web app works minimally. I couldn't figure out a way to get this done more efficiently as we lack an automated user testing tool.


Security scans

Our team is already very good about security scanning and remediation. We also leaned on our security scanning tool to identify "information leakage" vulnerabilities; that is, any PHP errors resulting from old code running on a new environment or any bugs we introduced in our refactors.
 

In future:

Because PHP Storm requires a license and opening an editor to run an inspection, I wouldn't use it.
