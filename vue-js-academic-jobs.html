<p>I recently had the opportunity to build a site with Vue.js.<p>

<p>Vue.js is a javascript framework for building reactive web sites. I picked it for academicjobs.uchicago.edu because the requirements could be covered by this client-side framework, and quickly. </p>

<p>Academicjobs.uchicago.edu has only three pages, the data is read-only, and there are some reactive behaviors like incremental search and faceting. Vue.js is used to manipulate the DOM quickly based on events, so this is a good fit.</p>

<p>You use Vue directives inside of regular HTML tags which are ties to methods in your javascript. A simple example at https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/#Handling-User-Input shows a lot of reactive behavior:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The div ID ties this DOM element to the Vue object code. </li>
  <li>The message variable in the template is bound to data in the Vue object. </li>
  <li>The click event is tied to the reverseMessage function.</li>
  <li>The reverseMessage function changes the value of message, which triggers a re-rendering of the DOM element.</li>
</ul>

<p>Vue.js has conditional and loop directives as well.</p>

<p>Vue.js is easy to learn, and you can take it as far as you want to go. You can sprinkle it into an existing site for just a small reactive element, or you can build an entire app with its build tools. </p>
